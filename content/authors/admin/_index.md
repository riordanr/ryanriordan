I am an expert in market microstructure including the use of algorithms in the trading process. My work focuses on the market quality effects of market automation, the use of algorithms to buy and sell securities, and how prices are discovered in equity, option, bond and crypto markets. Recently have focused on topics in sustainable finance. My work has been published in the Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, the Review of Financial Studies, and other leading finance journals. My papers have received numerous best-paper awards, including one from the Review of Financial Studies. I have chaired conferences including the European Retail Investment Conference, and the SAFE Market Microstructure conference. I launched the first FinTech masters program in Canada.
